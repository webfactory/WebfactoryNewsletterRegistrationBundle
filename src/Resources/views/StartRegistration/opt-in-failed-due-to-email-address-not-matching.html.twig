<h1>Newsletter Registration Confirmation Failed</h1>

<p>
    There seems to be something wrong with this url: The provided email address doesn't seem to match the one used
    during the registration. Please use only the link we've send you to that email address.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe the link url in the email got wrapped at the line end? In this case, concatenate the link parts without spaces
    inbetween and paste the result in the url field of your browser.
